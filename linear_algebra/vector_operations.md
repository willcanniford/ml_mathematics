# Operations with vectors
We can consider a vector as something that moves us around space, with the values indicating the changes that we must take; this makes the vectors an action. 

Vectors can also be thought of as a list of attributes for an object i.e. each element in the vector is a particular attribute for that vector object. 

## Vector addition
When adding one vector to another, it is similar to applying one to the end of the other. The order of operations in this case doesn't matter i.e. `x + y = y + x`

The addition is associative which means that it doesn't matter where we add a bracket when adding multiple vectors together: 
`(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)`

## Scalar multiplication
This is multiplying a vector by a set constant i.e. * 3 would make the vector 3 times as large and * 0.5 would halve the vector values. 

Note that negative multiplication here means going in the opposite direction to the positive vector. In a coordinate system this means that we are multipying each individual element by the scalar: `[1, 2, 4] * 3 = [3, 6, 12]`
